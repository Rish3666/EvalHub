## ⚡ Overview
EvalHub is a terminal-inspired developer platform that goes beyond resumes. It uses AI to dissect repository metadata, project architecture, and code frequency to build a **Score Card** that proves your skills.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. AI Analysis & Score Cards
- **Deep Repository Scan**: Analyzes READMEs, tech stacks, and file complexity.
- **Dynamic Interviewing**: Project-specific questions generated by Gemini AI.
- **Dev Score**: A 0-100% metric based on activity, complexity, and technical proficiency.

### 2. Match Connectivity (Company View)
- **Compatibility Index**: Direct alignment checks between your tech stack and company-specific requirements.
- **Synched Modules**: Visual breakdown of matching skills vs. protocol gaps.
- **Target Seeker**: Search and simulate matches with top companies.

### 3. Community Nodes (Real-time Messaging)
- **Networking Layers**: Create or join "Nodes" (communities) based on tech interest.
- **Terminal Chat**: Low-latency polling-based chat with @mentions and threading.
- **Global Leaderboard**: See where you rank in the global developer hierarchy.

### 4. Digital Fingerprint (Profile)
- **Work Time Distribution**: Mon-Sun activity heatmaps.
- **GitHub Sync**: Auto-import repositories and following lists.
- **Network Discovery**: Instantly ping users you follow on GitHub to connect within EvalHub.
